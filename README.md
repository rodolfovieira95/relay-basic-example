It's an basic example on how to use React together with Relay. In order to make this repo work you have to download another repo containing the server in [this link](https://github.com/rodolfovieira95/graphqlMiddleware).

## Scripts

`start`: Runs the `relay` script before running the project.
`build`: Runs the `relay` script before building the project.
`relay`: Runs the relay compiler and and gets the schema and generates the types from the server.

`schema`: Gets the schema from the server and save on `schema.graphql`
